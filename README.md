# Attack-macOS

Attack-macOS is a library of scripts mapped to MITRE ATT&CK. Security teams can use attack-macOS to execute techniques and produce telemetry that facilitates detection opportunities in macOS environments.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each script is self-contained and can be used independently or combined for complex scenarios.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and extend for specific testing needs.
- **macOS Native**: All scripts use native tools and languages, including Bash, Swift, and AppleScript.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapped**: All scripts are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.
- **Logging**: Built-in capability to log script output for analysis.
- **Encoding**: Multiple options to encode data (Base64, hex) for various testing scenarios.
- **Encryption**: Integrated functions to encrypt data with AES, Blowfish, and GPG.
- **Exfiltration**: Simulated data exfiltration via HTTP or DNS protocols.

## Get started

You can execute attack-macOS scripts directly from the command line. For example:

```bash
./Collection/keychain_dump.sh
```

For more detailed usage instructions, use ```--help.```
