# msgIntel: Messages Intelligence Tool

## Overview
msgIntel is a sophisticated tool designed to extract and analyze data from various databases related to Messages and other communication services on macOS. It provides a comprehensive view of user communications, contacts, and associated metadata, offering valuable insights for data analysis and potential surveillance applications.

## Objectives
1. Extract and analyze recent messages and associated metadata
2. Retrieve and process contact information, including nicknames and sharing preferences
3. Access and interpret collaboration notices and other communication-related data
4. Provide a foundation for advanced analysis and correlation of communication patterns

## Key Features

### 1. Data Extraction
- Retrieves recent messages from the main chat database
- Extracts nicknames from the nickname cache
- Accesses handle sharing preferences
- Retrieves collaboration notices

### 2. Database Access
The tool interacts with the following databases:
- Main chat database: `/Users/[username]/Library/Messages/chat.db`
- Nickname cache: `/Users/[username]/Library/Messages/NickNameCache/nickNameKeyStore.db`
- Handle sharing preferences: `/Users/[username]/Library/Messages/NickNameCache/handleSharingPreferences.db`
- Collaboration notices: `/Users/[username]/Library/Messages/CollaborationNoticeCache/collaborationNotices.db`

### 3. Data Analysis
- Analyze message frequency and patterns
- Identify most frequent contacts and communication networks
- Detect unusual communication patterns or new contacts
- Implement keyword searching across messages
- Categorize messages by topic or sentiment

### 4. Timeline Construction
- Create a chronological view of communications
- Link messages to other system events or app usage

### 5. Cross-Application Correlation
- Link Messages data with other communication apps (if accessible)
- Correlate message data with calendar events or notes

### 6. Reporting and Visualization
- Generate comprehensive reports of findings
- Create visualizations of communication patterns and networks

## Usage
The tool is executed via the command line using the `osascript` command:

```
osascript -l JavaScript msgIntel.js [OPTION]
```
