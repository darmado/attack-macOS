## Identifying and Leveraging Trust Boundaries

This document outlines the technical aspects of identifying trust boundaries within a system and exploring alternative methods of interacting with them. It provides a structured approach to understanding, analyzing, and potentially bypassing security controls and service boundaries.

###  Purpose
This document guides security professionals and penetration testers in identifying trust boundaries and developing techniques to interact with them in unconventional ways.

##

### Assumptions
- The reader has a solid understanding of system architecture and security concepts.
- This analysis is being performed in a controlled, authorized environment.

##

### 1. Map System Architecture
- Identify all services, components, and security controls within the system.
- Document the normal flow of data and interactions between components.

##

### 2. Identify Trust Boundaries
- Locate points where trust levels change between system components.
- Determine what security checks and validations occur at these boundaries.

##

### 3. Analyze Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
- Study the protocols and methods used for authentication at each boundary.
- Understand how authorization decisions are made post-authentication.

##

### 4. Explore Data Flows
- Trace how data moves between trust boundaries.
- Identify potential points where data transformations or validations occur.

##

### 5. Investigate Alternative Interaction Methods
- Consider non-standard ways of interacting with services or crossing boundaries.
- Look for undocumented APIs, legacy protocols, or debug interfaces.

##

### 6. Analyze Error Handling
- Study how the system responds to invalid inputs or unauthorized access attempts.
- Look for information leakage or inconsistent responses that could be leveraged.

##

### 7. Test Boundary Conditions
- Probe the edges of allowed behaviors at trust boundaries.
- Experiment with edge cases in input validation, data formats, and protocol usage.

##

### 8. Leverage Legitimate Credentials Creatively
- Explore using valid credentials in unexpected ways or contexts.
- Test if access granted in one area can be extended to others.

##

### 9. Exploit Trust Relationships
- Identify where one component implicitly trusts another.
- Investigate if this trust can be mimicked or abused.

##

### 10. Document and Analyze Findings
- Record all identified boundaries and potential alternative interaction methods.
- Analyze the security implications of each finding.

##

### 11. Develop and Test Exploitation Techniques
- Based on findings, develop techniques to bypass or misuse trust boundaries.
- Test these techniques in a controlled environment.

##

### 12. Consider Ethical and Legal Implications
- Ensure all testing is performed within authorized scope and legal boundaries.
- Document potential real-world impacts of identified vulnerabilities.
