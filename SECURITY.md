# Security posture and deployment assumptions

## Purpose

This document states trust boundaries for running attack-macOS maintainer tooling in pipelines, labs, or integrations, and separates controls implemented in this repository from controls expected in the deployment environment.

## Assumptions

1. The organization operating the tooling controls access to the repository checkout (clone integrity, branch protection, and review before merge).
2. Pipeline and lab hosts are patched, least-privilege accounts are used for jobs, and network egress is restricted according to organizational policy.
3. Operators who invoke `cicd/` fetch or convert commands are authorized for those actions within their environment.
4. Maintainer Python applies CLI input checks documented in `docs/CICD/python_cli_security.md` and `cicd/validate_input.py` where wired; those checks reduce misuse of URLs and path tokens but do not replace host-level integrity controls.

## Audience

Security teams, DevOps engineers, and auditors evaluating how attack-macOS should run in controlled environments.

## Scope

In scope: repository-supplied maintainer scripts, documented CLI safety expectations, and deployment assumptions for integrity and isolation.

Out of scope: Organizational SOC2, ISO, or incident-response programs; configuration of specific commercial CI products.

## Details

### Controls provided in this repository

- `cicd/validate_input.py` and related patterns restrict URL schemes and token shapes for selected maintainer CLIs.
- `docs/CICD/python_cli_security.md` documents expectations (for example, avoiding `shell=True` with user-controlled strings).

### Controls expected in the deployment environment

- Checkout integrity and protected branches.
- Runner or container isolation, secrets management, and egress rules for steps that fetch third-party content (Atomic Red Team, LOOBins, and similar).
- Identity and access management for operators and service accounts.

### Optional integration patterns

Many teams run CI steps in containers or ephemeral VMs with read-only roots and network policies. Runtime choice (for example Docker, Kubernetes, or containerd-backed stacks) is an organizational decision.

## Exceptions

- Projects that vendor or repackage this repository may impose additional controls not listed here.
