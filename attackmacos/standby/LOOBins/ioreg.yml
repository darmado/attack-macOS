example_use_cases:
- name: Use ioreg to check whether the remote macOS screen is locked.
  description: The following command will display a list of keys that contain "CGSSession". If the key "CGSSessionScreenIsLocked" is present, the screen is actively locked.
  code: ioreg -n Root -d1 -a | grep CGSSession

- name: Use ioreg to check USB device vendor names
  description: Grep for "USB Vendor Name" values to view USB vendor names. On virtualized hardware these values may contain the hypervisor name such as "VirtualBox". This is an additional way to check for virtualization.
