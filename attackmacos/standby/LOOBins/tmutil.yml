created: 2023-05-01
example_use_cases:
- name: Disable Time Machine
  description: The following command disables Time Machine. An attacker can use this to prevent backups from occurring.
  code: tmutil disable
  tactics:
  - Impact
  tags:
  - backup
- name: Delete a backup
  description: The following command deletes the specified backup. An adversary may perform this action before launching a ransonware attack to prevent the victim from restoring their files.
  code: tmutil delete /path/to/backup
  tactics:
  - Impact
  tags:
  - delete
- name: Restore a backup
  description: The following command restore the specified backup. An attacker can use this to restore a backup of a sensitive file that was deleted.
  code: tmutil restore /path/to/backup
  tactics:
  - Collection
  tags:
  - restore
- name: Tamper with system logs
  description: An adversary can use the snapshot and restore commands together to tamper with system logs. This is fixed in macOS 10.15.4+.
  code: >- 
    mkdir /tmp/snapshot
    
    tmutil localsnapshot

    tmutil listlocalsnapshots /

    mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2023-05-01-090000.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snapshot

    open /tmp/snapshot

    sudo vim /var/log/system.log

    tmutil restore com.apple.TimeMachine.2023-05-01-090000.local
  tactics:
  - Privilege Escalation
  tags:
  - unprivileged
- name: Exclude path from backup
  description: An adversary could exclude a path from Time Machine backups to prevent certain files from being backed up.
  code: tmutil addexclusion /path/to/exclude

  - backup
paths:
- /usr/bin/tmutil
