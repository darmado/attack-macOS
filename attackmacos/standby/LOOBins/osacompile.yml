short_description: Compile AppleScripts or OSA language scripts.
full_description: osacompile is a utility used to compile scripts into executables. It's a component of Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) that Apple uses for its scripting languages, like AppleScript and JavaScript for Automation (JXA). osacompile accepts AppleScript code as input and produces a compiled script file, which can be either a script file (.scpt), an app (.app), a droplet, or a script bundle.
