example_use_cases:
  - name: Use the textutil to read several files and build a new file
    description: A one-liner can load the content of multiple RTF files in a directory, concatenate their contents, and write the results out as a new file. This provides two sub-use-cases; one is building a malicious file from a collection of smaller files which could evade both network and host-based security controls as the traditional means of signature-based detection would be redundant; two is concatenating the content of several, potentially sensitive files before exfiltration. This command can also be looped to iterate a directory of files.

  - name: Capture clipboard content
    description: By leveraging another command line tool, pbpaste, it is possible to write a one-liner which captures the content of the clipboard. If an attacker already has access to the system, the attacker could run this command to obtain sensitive information such as a password and then elevate their privileges or exfiltrate the information.
