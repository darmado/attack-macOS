# OCR-Based Payload Extraction via HTTP

## Technical Overview
This document describes a theoretical technique for extracting executable content from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities available in operating systems.

## Technical Components

### 1. Image Retrieval
- **Source**: Images containing visible text/code
- **Transport**: Standard HTTP GET requests
- **Format**: Text displayed within image content

### 2. OCR Text Extraction
- Uses native OS OCR libraries to extract visible text from images
- Processes extracted text as potential executable content
- No external OCR libraries required

### 3. Process Implementation
- Parent process retrieves target image
- Child process extracts text using OCR
- Inter-process communication via pipes
- Parent receives processed text content

#### Technical Flow:
1. Process fetches image via HTTP request
2. Spawns child process with pipe communication
3. Child applies OCR to extract visible text
4. Child processes and formats extracted text
5. Child returns processed content to parent via pipes
6. Parent handles received content

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- Operating system with built-in OCR capabilities
- Network access for image retrieval
- Process spawning and pipe communication capabilities

### Limitations
- OCR accuracy depends on image quality and text clarity
- Processing overhead for image analysis
- Dependent on availability of target images
- Text extraction reliability varies with image format
